Here are some data source files and some R programs that reads in the data, manipulates the data, then outputs visualisations and statistics.
The source files were given to me by companies I was interviewing for. The software was used to respond to the take home assignments.

### Example 1
The cumulative mean session length metric prominently displays session lengths trending over time to what appears to be their true central tendencies.

Proto_A consistently outperforms proto_B since early in the test.

### Example 2
The consistent outperformance of proto_B by proto_A has been statistically significant at the 95% confidence level for much of the test.
(Overlapping confidence intervals represent a p value > 0.05 and non overlapping intervals represent p values <= 0.05.) 
Confidence intervals narrowing as the test matured and a persisting delta are signs that proto_A may be the true session length maximizing variant.

This shows retention for different online marketing channels.
